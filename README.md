# Spammy Fundraisers

I've gone on the record saying how much I dislike startup fundraising advisors before [here](https://medium.com/kima-ventures/99-5-of-startup-fundraising-advisors-are-crooks-and-charlatans-aa8b672a5ee3#.ggsdn5d8k).

Inspired by @drcongo's [Spammy Recruiters](https://github.com/drcongo/spammy-recruiters) list, I've made a list of fundraising advisors that have sent me unsolicited emails pitching their clients.

I've only included those that have directly sent me a client company in the first email (not those reaching out to connect or get information) and only those from the last few months.

Startups shouldn't be paying a fundraising advisor for spamming investors.

I have set up a [Gmail filter](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en) to archive anyone emailing from these domains and to reply with a [Canned Response](http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gmail-templates-canned-responses).
